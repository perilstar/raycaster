# Raycaster

Originally I created this project in Scratch as a challenge for myself. Then I decided I wanted to add new featues to it and make it more performant, so I re-wrote it in JavaScript. It uses the CPU only in a single thread to do all the rendering, and then throws the result to the GPU for a CRT post-processing shader. Be warned: The code is messy and uncommented as I ported it at a time I already had forgotten what the Scratch code did.
